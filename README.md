- ⚡ Fun fact: ...How much does a cat sleep a day?
   Ans:  Anywhere from 16 to 20 hours a day, typically. For very young and very old cats, it's near the upper end of the range, and newborns sleep almost 24/7. While cats do spend at least two-thirds of their lives asleep, they're not “asleep” in quite the same way humans are.
